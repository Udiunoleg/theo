# FreshRSS General instructions

## KISS principle: Keep It Simple

* Prioritise simplicity, brevity, and clarity in code and documentation.
* Avoid premature abstractions or over-engineering.
* Reuse and adapt existing code where possible, avoiding duplication.
* Keep changes minimal and focused.
* Favour vanilla solutions: avoid adding third-party dependencies and frameworks.
* Overall, reduce the number of lines and quantity of code (including dependencies).

## Style and formatting

* When editing files, obey indentation and white-space as defined in [`.editorconfig`](../../.editorconfig) (some of it can be automatically fixed with `make fix-all`).

## Spelling

* Favour British English spelling and conventions in code, comments, and documentation.
